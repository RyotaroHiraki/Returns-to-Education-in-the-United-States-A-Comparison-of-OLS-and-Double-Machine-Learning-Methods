This repository contains the data analysis code and materials for my research project titled  
**"[Returns to Education in the United States A Comparison of OLS and Double Machine Learning Methods]"**.

## 📘 Overview

This project investigates [briefly describe your research question] using data from [data source, e.g. PISA 2018, CPS 2024].

The main focus is the assessment of model performance between OLS and DML on returns to education.

## 🛠 Methods

- Statistical Models: OLS, Double Machine Learning (DML) (Random Forest, XGBoost, GAMs, Neural Nets(MLP))
- Tools: R (fixest, tidyverse, ggplot2)
- Data Source: CPS 2024 cleaned and preprocessed in R
